      <h1>About WeConnect</h1>
      <p>WeConnect is a friend-making platform for Northwestern Students.
Making new friends can be both exciting and intimidating—especially at Northwestern University. With students from across the globe bringing diverse interests, backgrounds, and experiences, finding your community can feel like solving a puzzle. For most students, it’s their first extended time away from home, friends, and familiar routines.
How do you navigate building friendships on a campus of over 8,000 students while juggling challenging classes, awkward living situations, and less-than-stellar dining hall meals? Northwestern offers various avenues for connection: roommates, dormmates, PA groups, student organizations, group homework, campus events, Greek life, and more. But the reality is that most people you meet won’t share your unique interests, humor, or background. The journey to finding a community where you truly belong remains one of the most challenging parts of campus life.</p>
